                <p>Kimberly has brought the world of fellowship and friendship to a new platform, allowing you to be present from your computer for 60 to 90 minutes once a week with a small group of likeminded people who want to improve their lives with connectivity.</p>
                <p>Kimberly brings a level of spirituality and caring to the table that helps you to know you are in a safe place, with quite possibly the opportunity to make new friends along the way, who may make a difference in your life while growing and healing are always the goal.</p>
